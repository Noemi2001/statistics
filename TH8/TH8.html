            <p class="answer">  
                A <strong>stochastic process</strong> is a mathematical model that represents the evolution of a system over time in a way that is subject to random variations. In simpler terms, it's a collection of random variables indexed by time.<br>
                A stochastic process can be discrete-time or continuous-time. In discrete-time, the random variables evolve at distinct, separate points in time, while in continuous-time, they evolve continuously.

                </div>
                Stochastic processes have several properties:
                <ol>
                    <li> A stochastic process is <strong>stationary</strong> if its statistical properties remain constant over time. In other words, the mean, variance, and correlation structure of the process do not change.</li>
                    <li> A stochastic process has the <strong>Markov property</strong> if the future behavior of the process only depends on its current state, and not on its past history. </li>
                    <li> A stochastic process is a <strong>martingale</strong> if its expected value at any future time, given its current value, is equal to its current value.</li>
                    <li> A stochastic process is said to be <strong>ergodic</strong> if the time average of a random variable, computed along a single sample path, converges to the expected value as the time horizon goes to infinity.</li>
                </ol>
                Examples of stochastic processes include Poisson processes and Markov processes.

                <br><br>
                <strong> Differential Equations</strong> are differential equations that involve both deterministic and random components. They are used to model the evolution of systems where randomness plays a significant role.<br>
                The general form of a one-dimensional SDE is given by:
                    \[ dX_t = a(t, X_t) \, dt + b(t, X_t) \, dW_t \]
                    where \(X_t\) is the process, \(a(t, X_t)\) and \(b(t, X_t)\) are deterministic functions, \(dt\) represents the deterministic part, and \(dW_t\) represents the random part (Brownian motion). <br>

                <br>SDEs provide a way to describe how systems evolve over time when influenced by both deterministic forces and random fluctuations.
                <br>
                <br>The solution to an SDE is a stochastic process. To find it we will use Itô calculus but it is difficult to solve, for this reason we simulate it.
                <br>

                Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) appear today as a modeling tool in several sciences as telecommunications, economics, finance, biology, and quantum field theory.
                <ol>
                    <li> In finance, SDEs are often used to model the movement of asset prices. </li>

                    <li> In physics, SDEs are used to model the Brownian motion of particles in a fluid.</li>

                    <li> In biology, SDEs can be used to model population dynamics, where the growth of a population is influenced by both deterministic factors (e.g., birth rate) and random factors (e.g., environmental fluctuations). </li>
