      <h1>Thesis 3: Gaussian distribution</h1>
      <div class="section">
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p class="answer">
                Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem.
                <br>In statistics, a <strong> normal distribution </strong>or Gaussian distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable that is referred as N(μ,σ^2 ). <br> The general form of its probability density function is: <br>
                <script type="math/tex">
                    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
                </script>
                <br>The parameter µ is the mean or expectation value of the distribution, the parameter  is its standard deviation and its variance is σ^2.
                <br>
                A normal distribution is sometimes informally called a bell curve because of its shape: symmetric and unimodal with tails that appear to extend to positive and negative infinity. In a normal curve, approximately 68% of the values fall within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% fall within two standard deviations, and 99.7% fall within three standard deviations.
                <div class="image-grid">

                    </figure>
                </div>
                Moreover, Gaussian distributions have some unique properties. For instance, any linear combination of a fixed collection of normal deviates is a normal deviate.

                <br>
                <h6><strong>Standard normal distribution</strong></h6>
                The simplest case of a normal distribution is known as the standard normal distribution. This is a special case when μ=0 and σ=1, and it is described by this probability density function:
                <script type="math/tex">
                    \phi(z) = \frac{e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
                </script>
                <br>Where z is a continuous random variable that has a mean of 0 and a variance and standard deviation of 1. 
                <br>The 
                <script type="math/tex">
                    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} 
                </script> is there to make sure that the area under the PDF is equal to one. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <h6><strong>General normal distribution</strong></h6>
                Every normal distribution is a version of the standard normal distribution, whose domain has been stretched by the standard deviation and then translated by the mean value:
                <script type="math/tex">
                    f(x| \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{v} \psi\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)
                </script>
            </p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p class="answer">
                The Gaussian distribution has several utilities and applications, including:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Modeling Data</strong>: The Gaussian distribution is often used to model and describe real-world data. Many natural phenomena follow a normal distribution pattern. When data is approximately normally distributed, it allows for the use of various statistical techniques.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Statistical Inference</strong>: Many statistical tests rely on the assumption of normality, which simplifies the mathematical procedures and enhances the interpretability of results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Machine Learning</strong>: Gaussian distributions are used in various machine learning algorithms. For example, Gaussian Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that assumes that features follow a Gaussian distribution. Also, Gaussian Mixture Models are used for clustering and density estimation in unsupervised learning.
