        <p class="question">Question 1: What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines? Make examples of use in
            cybersecurity.</p>
        <p class="answer">Statistics is a discipline or a science that collects and analyzes data. There are many disciplines that
            use statistics: In Biology, the use of statistics is known as biostatistics or biometrics. It consists in
            collecting and analyzing the data received from experiments in order to decide results. Also, meteorology
            uses statistics in stochastic-dynamic prediction and weather forecasting. Physics and Mathematics use
            probability theory and statistics dealing with the estimation of large populations. For example, the
            phenomenological results of thermodynamics were developed using the mechanics of statistics.
            Information technology uses statistics to predict particular outcomes. In particular, statistics is used
            also in cybersecurity to identify intrusions and anomalous behavior and therefore protect against
            cyber-attacks. Using Statistics, machine learning and Big Data analytics were developed tools to perform
            anomaly detection. Statistical techniques are used also in classification, data mining, streaming data
            analysis, graph analysis, and machine learning.</p>

        <p class="question">Question 1-bis: What is the Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.</p>
        <p class="answer">The difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics is that: Descriptive Statistics
            consists in observe and analyze data from an entire known population. Inferential Statistics consists in
            observe a sample from a larger, unknown population. It involves making conclusions about the larger
            population based on the analysis of the sample.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="question">Question 2: Describe the concepts of variable, attribute, population, sample and dataset</p>
        <ul class="answer">
            <li><strong>Attribute:</strong> is a general abstract concept. In fact, it is any characteristic that can be
                measured in a study.</li>
            <li><strong>Variable:</strong> is a specific value that can be assigned to an attribute refers to a particular
                individual. It can also vary among individuals and from one observation to another.</li>
            <li><strong>Population:</strong> is a set of similar items called statistical units by which is possible to
                collect data that are necessary for a specific survey.</li>
            <li><strong>Sample:</strong> is a population’s subset. It must be representative and not biased, this means
                that the shape of the sample’s result has to be similar to the population one.</li>
            <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> is a collection of data that is usually represented by a table. It is composed by
                some columns that are the attribute observed, and many rows which are the data collected from every
                statistical unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Level of measurement:</strong> Level of measurement refers to the process of categorizing data based
                on their characteristics and properties. It represents the different set of values that a variable can
                assume.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="question">Question 3: Briefly describe the main sampling techniques</p>
        <ul class="answer">
            <li><strong>Simple random sampling (Probability):</strong> consists to give an identificatory number to each
                individual in a population, and then use a table of random numbers to decide which individuals have to
                be included. With this technique, each individual is chosen entirely by chance and each member of the
                population has an equal probability of being selected.</li>
            <li><strong>Clustered sampling (Probability):</strong> the population is subdivided in subgroups, called
                clusters, that are used as the sampling unit and they are randomly selected to be included in the
                study. Cluster sampling can be efficient when a study takes place over a wide geographical region. But,
                if the chosen clusters are not representative of the population, the risk of bias will increase.</li>
            <li><strong>Convenience sampling (Non-Probability):</strong> all participants are selected based on
                availability and willingness to take part. There is a significant risk of bias, and the sample may not be
                representative.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowball sampling (Non-Probability):</strong> Consists of asking existing subjects to nominate
                other individuals known to them, so the sample increases in size like a rolling snowball. Snowball
                sampling can be effective when a sampling frame is difficult to identify. However, there is a significant
                risk of selection bias.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="question">Question 4: Briefly describe the main experiment designs.</p>
        <ul class="answer">
            <li><strong>Bayesian experimental design:</strong> provides a general probability-theoretical framework from
                which other theories on experimental design can be derived. It is based on Bayesian inference to
                interpret the data collected during the experiment. This allows accounting for both any prior knowledge
                on the parameters to be determined as well as uncertainties in observations.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimal designs:</strong> are a class of experimental designs that are optimal with respect to
                some statistical criterion. This classification was created by Kirstine Smith and it allows parameters
                to be estimated without bias and with minimum variance. Also, it can reduce the costs of experimentation
                because non-optimal design requires a greater number of experimental runs to estimate the parameters with
                the same precision as an optimal design.</li>
