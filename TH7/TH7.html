                A <strong>stream of data</strong> refers to a continuous and potentially infinite flow of information that is generated and processed over time. Instead of being presented as a static set, a data stream continuously evolves.
                Here are some key characteristics of data streams:

                Examples of data streams include:
                <ol>
                    <li> Sensor Data: Data from IoT devices, such as temperature sensors, can be streamed in real-time.</li>
                    <li> Social Media Feeds: photos and posts on platforms like Instagram and Facebook form continuous streams of data.</li>
                    <li> Financial Transactions: Stock market data, currency exchange rates forming data streams.</li>
                    <li> Network Traffic: Data streams in the context of network monitoring include the continuous flow of packets and information across a network.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="answer"> 
                    Managing and analyzing data streams require specialized techniques and algorithms that can handle the challenges posed by the dynamic and continuous nature of the data. Online algorithms are one example of techniques designed for processing data streams efficiently.</li>

                <strong>Online algorithms</strong> for data streams are designed to process data as it arrives, rather than waiting for the entire dataset to be available. These algorithms are particularly useful when dealing with large or continuously generated datasets. Some common examples of code for online algorithms in the context of data streams are:<br><br>

                        <strong>Counting Elements in a Stream: </strong><br>
                        This algorithm is a process that incrementally counts the occurrences of each unique element in a data stream. Here's a mathematical description:
                        <br>Let \( S = [s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots] \) be an infinite sequence representing a data stream, where \( s_i \) is the \( i \)-th element in the stream.
                        Define \( \text{Counts}(S) \) as a function that, given a data stream \( S \), produces a set of counts \( C = \{(x_1, c_1), (x_2, c_2), \ldots\} \), where \( x_i \) represents a unique element in the stream and \( c_i \) represents the count of occurrences of \( x_i \) in the stream up to the current point in time.
                        <br>
                        The algorithm processes the stream incrementally, and for each new element \( s_i \) in the stream, it updates the count of \( s_i \) in \( C \). The update can be described as follows:
                        <br>
                        - If \( s_i \) is not present in \( C \), then \( C' = C \cup \{(s_i, 1)\} \).<br>
                        - If \( s_i \) is already present in \( C \) with count \( c_j \), then \( C' = C \setminus \{(s_i, c_j)\} \cup \{(s_i, c_j + 1)\} \).

                        <strong>Finding the Top k Elements:</strong><br>
                        This algorithm is a process that identifies and maintains a set of the \( k \) largest elements from a data stream. Here's a mathematical description:
                        <br>
                        Let \( S = [s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots] \) be an infinite sequence representing a data stream, where \( s_i \) is the \( i \)-th element in the stream.

                        Define \( \text{TopK}(S, k) \) as a function that, given a data stream \( S \) and an integer \( k \), produces a set \( T = \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k\} \), where \( t_i \) represents the \( i \)-th largest element in the stream up to the current point in time.

                        The algorithm maintains a min-heap \( H = [h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_k] \) with the property that \( h_1 \) is the smallest element in \( H \) (the root of the min-heap) and \( H \) contains the \( k \) largest elements seen so far.

                        The algorithm processes the stream incrementally, and for each new element \( s_i \) in the stream, it updates the set of top \( k \) elements. The update can be described as follows:
                        <br>
                        - If \( H \) has fewer than \( k \) elements, then \( H' = H \cup \{s_i\} \).<br>
                        - If \( H \) has \( k \) elements and \( s_i \) is larger than the smallest element in \( H \), then \( H' = (H \setminus \{h_1\}) \cup \{s_i\} \).

                        <strong>Calculating the Moving Average:</strong><br>
                        This algorithm is a process that computes the average of a fixed-size window of elements as it slides through a data stream. Here's a mathematical description:<br>

                        Let \( S = [s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots] \) be an infinite sequence representing a data stream, where \( s_i \) is the \( i \)-th element in the stream.

                        Define \( \text{MA}(S, w) \) as a function that, given a data stream \( S \) and a positive integer \( w \) (the window size), produces a sequence of moving averages \( M = [m_1, m_2, m_3, \ldots] \), where \( m_i \) is the average of the elements in the window from \( s_i \) to \( s_{i+w-1} \).

                        The algorithm processes the stream incrementally, and for each new element \( s_i \) in the stream, it updates the sequence of moving averages. The update can be described as follows:
                        <br>
                        - If \( i < w \), then \( m_i = \frac{1}{i} \sum_{j=1}^{i} s_j \), which is the average of the first \( i \) elements in the stream.<br>
                        - If \( i \geq w \), then \( m_i = \frac{1}{w} \sum_{j=i-w+1}^{i} s_j \), which is the average of the last \( w \) elements in the stream.
