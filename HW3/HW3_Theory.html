            <p class="question">Exercise 1 - Discussion Point: Is what you see what you expected? What about the averages of the distributions and the shapes of the histograms:
                do you see regularities, differences and can you attempt to explain what you see or guessing what are
                the "theoretical" limit distribution, when as N increases, and you can make the distribution simulation "more detailed" by increasing M ?</p>
            <p class="answer">
                The shape of the distributions will depend on the values of M, N, and P. If M is large, N is large, and P is small, I might expect a distribution that approximates a normal distribution.
                The shape of the histograms will be influenced by the values of M, N, and p. If M is large, the histogram is more likely to resemble a normal distribution. As N increases, the histogram may become more detailed, showing more variations. If M is small, the histogram shape will be more “uniform”, so the column’s lengths seem to be similar.

          <p class="question">Exercise 2: Recall briefly the definition and math notions relevant to "probability space" and make some simple examples, indicating among the triple of the space the meaning of each element in your particular example.
            If you wanted to model probabilistically the homework Exercise 1, explain what are the 3 sets of your probability space and their elements, in this case.</p>
          <ul class="answer">
            In probability theory, a probability space or a probability triple (Ω, F, P) is a mathematical construct that provides a formal model of a random process or "experiment". A probability space consists of three elements:
            <ol>
                <li> Sample Space (Ω): The sample space represents the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment or process.</li>
                <li> Event space (F): is a set of events. It is a collection of subsets of the sample space that defines which sets of events are considered "measurable" or "events of interest."</li>
                <li> Probability Function (P): The probability measure assigns a real number in the range [0, 1] to each event in the event space. </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            Example: Suppose you are modeling the outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die. In this case, the probability space is as follows:
            <ol>
                <li> Sample Space (Ω): The sample space represents all possible outcomes when rolling the die. Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, as these are the possible results when you roll a six-sided die.</li>
                <li> Event space (F): In this simple example, the sigma algebra could be all possible subsets of Ω, including the empty set and the sample space itself. Σ = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, ..., {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}}.</li>
                <li> Probability Function (P): For a fair die, the probability of each outcome is 1/6, as each face has an equal chance of landing face up. Therefore, P({1}) = P({2}) = P({3}) = P({4}) = P({5}) = P({6}) = 1/6. </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            To model probabilistically the homework Exercise 1, you would define the probability space as follows:
            <ol>
                <li> Sample Space (Ω): represents all possible scenarios or outcomes of the experiment. In this case, it might be a space of M systems, N attacks, and probability P.</li>
                <li> Event space (F): defines which events or combinations of the systems, attacks and probabilities. </li>
                <li> Probability Function (P): is the probability of a successful attack on a specific system that is specified by the user.</li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
