        <h1>Thesis 12: Ito Integration and Calculus, Concept and Didactical Simulations</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p class="answer">  
                Itô calculus, named by Kiyosi Itô, is an extension of calculus to stochastic processes such as Brownian motion, with applications in mathematical finance and stochastic differential equations. <br><br>The central concept is the Itô stochastic integral, a stochastic generalization of the Riemann–Stieltjes integral. In this integral, both integrands and integrators are stochastic processes.<br>

                The Itô stochastic integral is represented as \(Y_{t}=\int _{0}^{t}H_{s}\,dX_{s}\), where \(H\) is a locally square-integrable process adapted to the filtration generated by \(X\), which is a Brownian motion. The integral results in another stochastic process, and its evaluation involves considering a limit of a sequence of random variables.<br><br>

                Key results of Itô calculus include the integration by parts formula and Itô's lemma, which is a change of variables formula. These formulas differ from those in standard calculus due to quadratic variation terms.  
            </p>
            <p class="question">Integration by parts</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                Integration by parts holds significance in stochastic calculus. However, the integration by parts formula for the Itô integral deviates from the standard form due to the introduction of a quadratic covariation term. This addition stems from the unique nature of Itô calculus, which deals with processes exhibiting non-zero quadratic variation, a characteristic found in infinite variation processes like Brownian motion.

                For semimartingales X and Y, the Itô integration by parts formula is expressed as:

                \[ X_{t}Y_{t}=X_{0}Y_{0}+\int _{0}^{t}X_{s-}\,dY_{s}+\int _{0}^{t}Y_{s-}\,dX_{s}+[X,Y]_{t}, \]

                where \([X, Y]\) represents the quadratic covariation process.
            </p>
            <p class="question">Itô Lemma</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                Itô's lemma is a specialized version of the chain rule or change of variables formula tailored for the Itô integral, making it a fundamental and extensively applied theorem in stochastic calculus. It is particularly powerful in dealing with continuous n-dimensional semimartingales, denoted as \(X = (X_1, ..., X_n)\), and twice continuously differentiable functions \(f\) from \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to \(\mathbb{R}\).
                <br>
                The lemma asserts that if \(f\) is twice continuously differentiable, then \(f(X)\) is a semimartingale, and its differential can be expressed as:

                \[ df(X_{t}) = \sum _{i=1}^{n}f_{i}(X_{t})\,dX_{t}^{i} + {\frac {1}{2}}\sum _{i,j=1}^{n}f_{i,j}(X_{t})\,d[X^{i},X^{j}]_{t}. \]

                This formula distinguishes itself from the standard chain rule in classical calculus by incorporating the term involving the quadratic covariation \([X^{i},X^{j}]\).
            </p>
            <p class="question">Application</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                In mathematical finance, the Itô stochastic integral is conceptualized as the payoff of a continuous-time trading strategy, with the condition of adaptation ensuring the strategy uses only available information.
                The process \(Y_{t}=\int _{0}^{t}H\,dX\) is a stochastic process, representing the total value of a trading strategy involving the amount \(H_{t}\) of stock at time \(t\).

            <p class="question">Simulation</p> 
            <p class="answer">
                The simulation I provided captures the essential elements of an Ito process based on the key characteristics of such processes:
                <br><br>
                1. Time Step (\(dt\)): The simulation uses a time step (\(dt\)) to discretize the time evolution of the process. This is a fundamental concept in numerical simulations of stochastic processes, including Ito processes. By updating the process at discrete intervals, we approximate its continuous-time evolution.
                <br><br>
                2. Brownian Motion Increment (\(dW\)): The simulation generates a random increment (\(dW\)) at each time step, simulating the stochastic behavior of Brownian motion. The increment is scaled by \(\sqrt{dt}\) to account for the square root of time step appearing in the Ito process.
                <br><br>
                3. Process Update (\(x += dW\)): The Ito process is updated based on the Brownian motion increment, reflecting the core characteristic of Ito processes. The Wiener increment (\(dW\)) represents the random component that leads to the diffusion of the process.
